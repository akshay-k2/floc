Each of the client scripts can be used to deploy federated learning model on up to 2, 4, and 8 Pynq-Z2 boards. `fl.py` and the relevant datasets must be uploaded on each board prior to deploying.

The required datasets can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ow0x6nfzlr2sm9c/AAD4vMufPM4w-VsrAU3dlGJJa?dl=0).
